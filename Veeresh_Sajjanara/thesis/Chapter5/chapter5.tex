\section{Introduction}\label{sec5.1}

The concept of generalized homeomorphism was derived and studied in the year 1991 by Maki et all \cite{key5}. N. Nagaveni \cite{key25} introduced and investigated rwg homeomorphism in topological space. In the year 2002, M Sheik John \cite{key30} introduced and investigated w-homeomorphism in topological space. The intention of the paper is to analyze and study ws-homeomorphism, ws*-homeomorphism and their relation with some existing homeomorphisms in topological space. Also some of their properties have been verified.

In second of this chapter, we to introduce and study ws-homeomorphism, ws*-homeomorphism and their relation with some existing homeomorphisms in topological space. Also some of their properties have been investigated

\section{ws-Homeomorphism in Topological Space}\label{sec5.2}

\begin{dfn}\label{defi5.2.1}
A bijective map $\TSh: (\TSP,\tau)\to (\TSQ,\sigma)$ is termed as ws-homeomor\-phism if $\TSh$ is both ws-continuous and ws-open.
\end{dfn}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.2} 
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ=\{1,2,3\}$, $\tau =\{\TSP, \phi,\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$ and $\sigma =\{\TSQ,\phi,\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSQ$ and $\ws\TSC(\TSP)= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2\},\{3\}, \{1, 3\},\{2, 3\}\}$ And $\ws\TSO(\TSQ) =\{\TSQ, \phi,\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\}\}$. Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ defined by identity map then $\TSh$ is ws-homeomorphism 
\end{exm}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.3}
Each homeomorphism is a ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ be a homeomorphism. Then $\TSh$ is bijective, continuous and open map. Since each continuous map is ws-continuous and each open map is ws-open, $\TSh$ is ws-homeomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.4}
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ= \{1, 2, 3\}$. Let $\tau= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2\},\break \{1,2\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$  and $\sigma=\{\phi, \TSQ, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1 3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSQ$ and $\ws\TSC(\TSP)= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2\},\{3\}, \{1,3\},\{2, 3\}\}$. Let $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau )\to (\TSQ, \sigma)$ be a function defined by identity map is ws-homeomorphism but not a homeomorphism as the closed set $\TSH=\{2\}$ in $\TSQ, h^{-1} (\TSH)=\{2\}$ is not a closed in $\TSP$ hence not a continuous function therefore not a homeomorphism.
\end{exm}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.5}
If a map $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ is homeomorphism then the following holds.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Each semi-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item Each Î±-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item Each g\#-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item Each *g$\alpha$-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item Each g$\xi$*-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item Each $\alpha$gp-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item Each $\ddot{g}$-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item Each regular-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue
\item Each rb-homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ be a homeomorphism. Then $\TSh$ is bijective, continuous and open map. Since each semi (respectively, $\alpha$, g$^{\text{\#}}$, *g$\alpha$, g$\xi$*, $\alpha$gp, $\ddot{g}$, regular and $rb$) continuous map is ws-continuous and each semi-(respectively, $\alpha$, g, *g$\alpha$, g$\xi$*, $\alpha$gp $\ddot{g}$, regular and $rb$) -open map is ws-open, $\TSh$ is ws-homeomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.6}
In Example \ref{exam5.2.3}, $\TSh$ is ws-homeomorphism but not a semi (respectively, $\alpha$, g$^{\#}$, *g$\alpha$, g$\xi$*, $\alpha$gp, $\ddot{g}$, regular and $rb$) homeomorphism as the closed set $\TSH=\{2\}$ in $\TSQ$, $h^{-1} (\TSH)=\{2\}$ is not a semi (respectively, $\alpha$, g\#, *g$\alpha$, g$\xi$*, $\alpha$gp, $\ddot{g}$, regular and $rb$) closed in $\TSP$.
\end{exm}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.7}
Each g\#s - homeomorphism is ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Take up $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau) \to (\TSQ, \sigma)$ be a homeomorphism. Then $\TSh$ is bijective, continuous and open map. Since each g\#s - continuous map is ws-continuous and each g\#s- open map is ws-open, $\TSh$ is ws-homeomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.8}
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ= \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. Let $\tau= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\},\break \{1,2,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$ and a $\sigma=\{\phi,\TSQ,\{1\},\{1,2\},\{1,2,3\}\}$ be topology on $\TSQ$, and $\ws\TSC(\TSP)=\{\TSP,\phi,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{4\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{3,4\},\{1,2,4\},\break \{1,2,4\},\{2,3,4\}\}$, $\text{g\#s}\TSC(\TSP)=\{\TSP, \phi,\{2\},\{3\},\{4\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{3,4\},\{2,3,4\}\}$,\break $\ws\TSO(\TSQ)=\{\TSQ, \phi, \{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\}, \{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,3,4\}\},$ g\#s$\TSO(\TSQ)=\{\TSQ,\phi,\{1\},\{1,2\},\{3,4\},\{1,4\},\{1,2,3\}\{1,2,4\},\{1,3,4\}\}$ Let $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau )\break \to (\TSQ, \sigma)$ be a function defined by $\TSh(1)= 1$, $\TSh(2)=2$, $\TSh(3)=3$, $\TSh(4)=2$, is ws-homeomorphism but not a homeomorphism hunction as the open set $\TSH=\{3,4\}$ in $\TSQ$, $h^{-1} (\TSH)=\{1,2\}$ is not a g\#s-closed in $\TSP$ hence not a continuous function therefore not a g\#s-homeomorphism.
\end{exm}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.9}
If a map $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ is homeomorphism then
\begin{itemize}
\item[(iv)] If $\TSh$ is ws-homeomorphism then it is gspr-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item[(v)] If $\TSh$ is ws-homeomorphism then it is gsp-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\item[(vi)] If $\TSh$ is ws-homeomorphism then it is rgb-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Take up $\TSh: (\TSP,\tau)\to (\TSQ, \sigma)$ be ws-homeomorphism. Then $\TSh$ is both ws-continuous and ws-open map. This implies that $\TSh$ is both gspr continuous and gspr open map. Therefore $\TSh$ is gspr-homeomorphism.

Similarly we can prove (ii) and (iii).
\end{proof}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.10}
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ= \{1, 2, 3,4\}$. Let $\tau= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\},\break \{1,2,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$ and a $\sigma=\{\phi,\TSQ,\{1,2\},\{3,4\}\}$ be topology on $\TSQ$ and $\ws\TSC(\TSP)=\gsp\TSC(\TSP)=\{\TSP,\phi,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{4\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{3,4\},\break \{1,2,4\},\{1,3,4\},\{2,3,4\}$, $\gspr\TSC(\TSP)=\rgb\TSC(\TSP)=\{\TSP(\TSP)\}$, $\ws\TSO(\TSQ)=\{\phi,\TSQ,\{1,2\},\break \{3,4\}\}$, $\gspr\TSC(\TSQ)=\rgb\TSC(\TSQ)= \gsp\TSC(\TSQ)=\{\TSP(\TSQ)\}$, and Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ defined by $\TSh(1)=1$, $\TSh(2)= 2$, $\TSh(3)=3$, $\TSh(4)=2$ then $\TSh$ is gsp-homeomorphism(respectively, gsp-homeomorphism, rgb-homeomorphism). But not ws-homeomorphism, as open set $\TSF= \{1\}$ in $\TSP$, then, $h^{-1} (\TSF) = \{1\}$ is not ws-open set in $\TSQ$.
\end{exm}

\begin{rem}\label{rem5.2.11}
Following example shows that ws-homeomorphism is independent of g, w, $\beta$, gp, g$\alpha$, swg, rwg, wg, g*p, gw$\alpha$, $\alpha${*}{*}g, swg*, gr, w$\alpha\hat{g}$, g$\alpha$*, rg, rg$\alpha$ R*, rgw, wgr$\alpha$, gprw, pgr$\alpha$, g$\alpha${*}{*}, $\beta$wg{*}{*}, mildly g-homeomorphisms.
\end{rem}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.12}
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ= \{1, 2, 3\}$. Let $\tau= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$ and $\sigma=\{\phi, \TSQ, \{1\},\{2,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSQ$ and $\ws\TSC(\TSP)=\{\TSP, \phi,\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\},\{2,3\},\{1, 3\}\}$, Let $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau)\to (\TSQ, \sigma)$ be a function defined by $\TSh(1)=1$, $\TSh(2)= 1$, $\TSh(3)=1$ is ws-homeomorphism but not g, w, $\beta$, gp, g$\alpha$, swg, rwg, wg, g*p, gw$\alpha$, $\alpha${*}{*}g, swg*, gr, w$\alpha\hat{g}$, g$\alpha$*, rg, rg$\alpha$, R*, rgw, wgr$\alpha$, gprw, pgr$\alpha$, g$\alpha${*}{*}, $\beta$wg{*}{*}, mildly g-homeomorphisms as the closed set $\TSH=\{1\}$ in $\TSQ$, $h^{-1}(\TSH)=\{1\}$ is not a g(respectively w, $\beta$, gp, g$\alpha$, swg, rwg, wg, g*p, gw$\alpha$, $\alpha${*}{*}g, swg*, gr, w$\alpha\hat{g}$, g$\alpha$*, rg, rg$\alpha$, R*, rgw, wgr$\alpha$, gprw, pgr$\alpha$, g$\alpha${*}{*}, $\beta$wg{*}{*}, mildly g)closed set in $\TSP$.
\end{exm}

\begin{exm}\label{exm5.2.13}
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ= \{1, 2, 3\}$. Let $\tau= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$ and $\sigma=\{\phi, \TSQ, \{1\},\{2\}, \{1,2\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSQ$ and $\ws\TSC(\TSP)= \{\phi, \TSP,\{1\},\{2,3\}\}$. Let $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau )\to (\TSQ, \sigma)$ be a function defined by $\TSh(1)=3$, $\TSh(2)= 2$, $\TSh(3)=3$, is g, w, $\beta$, gp, g$\alpha$, swg, rwg, wg, g*p, gw$\alpha$, $\alpha${*}{*}g, swg*, gr, w$\alpha\hat{g}$, g$\alpha$*, rg, rg$\alpha$, R*, rgw, wgr$\alpha$, gprw, pgr$\alpha$, g$\alpha${*}{*}, $\beta$wg{*}{*}, mildly g-homeomorphisms but not ws-homeomorphism as the closed set $\TSH=\{3\}$ in $\TSQ$, $h^{-1} (\TSH)=\{1,3\}$ is not a ws-closed in $\TSP$.
\end{exm}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.14}
Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ be bijective and ws-continuous map. Henceforth following results are one and the same.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\TSh$ is a ws-open map
\item $\TSh$ is a ws-homeomorphism
\item $\TSh$ is a ws-closed map
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
(1) $\Rightarrow$ (2)

Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ be bijective, ws-continuous map and ws-open map. Therefore $\TSh$ is a ws-homeomorphism.

(2) $\Rightarrow$ (3)

Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ be a ws-homeomorphism. Let $\TSG$ be any closed set $\in \TSP$ and hence $\TSG^{\text{c}}$ is closed in $\TSP$. Then $\TSh(\TSG^{\text{c}})$ is open in $\TSQ$. But $\TSh(\TSG^{\text{c}})=\TSh(\TSG)^{\text{c}}$. Therefore $\TSh$ is a ws-closed map.

(3) $\Rightarrow$ (1)

Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ be bijective, ws-continuous and ws-closed map. Assume $\TSG$ be any open set $\in \TSP$ and hence $\TSG^{\text{c}}$ is closed $\in \TSP$. Then $\TSh(\TSG^{\text{c}})$ is closed $\in \TSQ$. But $\TSh(\TSG^{\text{c}})=\TSh(G)^{\text{c}}$. Therefore $\TSh$ is a ws-open map.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}\label{rem5.2.15}
The composition of two ws-homeomorphism is not a ws-homeomor\-phism in general as seen in example \ref{exam5.2.16}.
\end{rem}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.16}
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ=\TSR= \{1, 2, 3\}$. Let $\tau= \{\TSP, \phi, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\},\break \{1,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$, $\sigma= \{\TSQ, \phi, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSQ$ and $\eta= \{\TSZ, \phi, \{1\}, \{2,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSR$ and $\wsc(\TSP)= \{\TSP, \phi, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2, 3\}\}$, $\wsc(\TSQ)= \{\TSQ, \phi, \{1\},\{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,3\}, \{2, 3\}\}$ $\wsc(\TSR)= \{\TSR, \phi, \{1\}, \{2, 3\}\}$. Define $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau) \to (\TSQ,\sigma)$ by $\TSh(1)=1$, $\TSh(2) =2$, $\TSh(3)=3$ and $\TSg: (\TSQ,\sigma)\to (R, \eta)$ be a function defined by $\TSh(1)=1$, $\TSh(2)= 1$, $\TSh(3)=1$. Both $\TSh$ and $\TSg$ are ws-homeomorphism but their composition go$\TSh: (\TSP, \tau)\to (\TSR, \eta)$ defined by identity function is not a ws-homeomorphism as the closed set $\TSH=\{1\}$ in $(\TSR, \eta)$, but $(goh)^{-1} (\TSH)=\{1\}$ is not ws-closed in $\TSP$.
\end{exm}

\begin{dfn}\label{defi5.2.17}
A bijective map $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ is called a ws*-homeomorphism if $\TSh$ and $h^{-1}$ are ws-irresolute. Where ws*-$\TSh(\TSP, \tau)$ denote the set of all ws-homeomorphisms of $\TSP$ on to itself.
\end{dfn}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.18}
Each ws*-homeomorphism is a ws-homeomorphism but inverse is untrue.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Proof: Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ be a ws*-homeomorphism. Then $\TSh$ is bijective, $\TSh$ and $h^{-1}$ are ws-irresolute. Since each ws-irresolute map is ws-continuous then $\TSh$ and $h^{-1}$ are ws-continuous. Also $h^{-1} : \TSQ \to \TSP$ is a ws-continuous map is one and the same. to ws-open map. Thus $\TSh$ is bijective, ws-continuous and ws-open map. Hence $\TSh$ is a ws-homeomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.19}
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ= \{1, 2, 3\}$. Let $\tau= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\},\{1,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$ and $\sigma=\{\phi, \TSQ, \{1\}, \{2\},\{1,2\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSQ$ and $\ws\TSC(\TSP)\break = \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\},\{3\}, \{1,3\},\{2,3\}\}$, $\SCL(\TSQ) =\{\phi, \TSQ, \{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{2, 3\},\{1,3\}\}$,\break $\ws\TSC(\TSQ)= \{\phi, \TSQ, \{1\},\{2\},\{3\}, \{1,3\},\{2,3\}\}$ Let $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau )\to (\TSQ, \sigma)$ be a function defined by identity function is ws-continuous but not a ws*-continuous function as the semi-closed set $\TSF=\{1\}$ in $\TSQ$, $h^{-1}(\TSF)=\{1\}$ not a ws-closed in $\TSP$.
\end{exm}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.20}
Each ws*-homeomorphism is a gspr-homeomorphism (resp gsp-homeomorphism, rgb-homeomorphism) but inverse is untrue.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Proof is obtained from the previous results, definations and evidence each ws*-homeomorphism is a ws-homeomorphism and each ws-homeomorphism is a gspr-homeomorphism (resp gsp-homeomorphism, rgb-homeomorphism)
\end{proof}

\begin{exm}\label{exam5.2.21}
Take up $\TSP=\TSQ= \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. Let $\tau= \{\phi, \TSP, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\},\break \{1,2,3\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSP$ and $\sigma=\{\phi,\TSQ,\{1,2\},\{3,4\}\}$ be a topology on $\TSQ$ and $\ws\TSC(\TSP)= \gsp\TSC(\TSP)=\{\TSP, \phi,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{4\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{3,4\},\break \{1,2,4\},\{1,3,4\},\{2,3,4\}\}$, $\gspr\TSC(\TSP)=\rgb\TSC(\TSP)=\{\TSP(\TSP)\}$, $\ws\TSO(\TSQ)=\{\phi,\TSQ,\{1,2\},\break \{3,4\}\}$, $\gspr\TSC(\TSQ)=\rgb\TSC(\TSQ)=\gsp\TSC(\TSQ)=\{\TSP(\TSQ)\}$. Take $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ defined by $\TSh(1)=1$, $\TSh(2)= 2$, $\TSh(3)=3$, $\TSh(4)=2$ then $\TSh$ is gsp-homeomorphism(Respectively, gsp-homeomorphism, homeomorphism). But not ws-homeomorphism, as open set $\TSH= \{1\}$ in $\TSP$, then, $h^{-1} (\TSH) = \{1\}$ which is not ws-open set in $\TSQ$.
\end{exm}

\begin{rem}\label{rem5.2.22} 
From the above discussions and known facts, the relation between ws-homeomorphism with some existing homeomorphisms in topological space is shown in
following figure.
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=.6]{1.eps}
\end{figure}
\end{rem}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.23} 
The composition of two ws*-homeomorphisms is also a\break ws*-homeomor\-phism.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Take up $\TSh: \TSP\to \TSQ$ and $\TSg: \TSQ\to \TSR$ be two ws*-homeomorphisms. Now we have to prove goh: $\TSQ\to \TSR$ be ws*-homeomorphism. Let $\TSN$ be any closed set in $\TSR$. Seeing that $\TSg$ is ws-irresolute, $\TSg(\TSN)$ is ws-closed $\in \TSQ$. Also $\TSh$ is ws-irresolute, $h^{-1} (g^{-1} (\TSN))$ is ws-closed in $\TSP$. But $h^{-1} (g^{-1}(\TSN))= (goh)^{-1}(\TSN)$. Therefore goh is ws-irresolute. Take $\TSW$ be any closed set in $\TSP$. Since $\TSh$ is ws-irresolute, $\TSh(\TSW)$ is ws-closed in $\TSQ$ and also $\TSg(\TSh(\TSW))$ is ws-closed in $\TSR$. But (goh)$(\TSW)=\TSg(\TSh(\TSW))$. Therefore (goh) is ws-irresolute. Hence (goh) is ws*-homeomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm5.2.24}
Under the composition of maps, the set ws*-$\TSh(\TSP, \tau)$ is a group.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Take up * be a binary operation, $*: \ws * \TSh(\TSP, \tau) \to  \ws * \TSh(\TSP, \tau)$ defined by $\TSh * \TSg = \text{goh}$ for all $\TSh$, $\TSg \in \ws * \TSh(\TSP, \tau)$. We have, $\text{goh} \in \ws * \TSh(\TSP,\tau)$. Also the associative property holds in composition of maps. The identity map $\TSI : (\TSP, \tau) \to  (\TSP, \tau)$ which $\in \ws *\TSh(\TSP, \tau)$, acts as the identity element. For the inverse element, if $\TSh \in \ws * \TSh(\TSP,\tau)$ then $h^{-1} \in \ws * \TSh(\TSP,\tau) \ni: hoh^{-1}=h^{-1}oh=\TSI$. Therefore, under the composition of maps, the set $\ws *-\TSh(\TSP,\tau)$ is a group.
\end{proof}
