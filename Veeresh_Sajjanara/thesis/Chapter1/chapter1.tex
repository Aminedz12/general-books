\section{Introduction}\label{sec1.1}

Topology is main branch of pure Mathematics the purpose of subject is to elucidate and inspect the concept of topological spaces, their continuity and continuos mapping, within the structure of Mathematics. The study of these and their general properties leads to a formation of general topology. The fundamental structure on a topological space is not a distance function, but a collection of open sets, thinking directly in terms of open sets often leads to greater clarity as well as greater generality. Here we present an detailed study of a new kind of generalized closed sets termed ws-closed sets and their respective continuous maps, closed maps, open maps, homeomorphisms, locally closed sets, locally continuous maps and bitopological spaces.

This thesis includes an overview on mathematicans and their work on toplogical spaces for the progress of topology. Second section discussion starts with stronger and weaker forms of open sets and closed sets. In third Section deals with stronger and weaker forms of continuous functions and irresolute maps. Section 4 deals with some closed maps, open maps, section 5 elaborates homeomorphisms. Section 6 Explains the concepts seperation of axioms and in section 7 Elobarates the concept of locally closed sets, furher LC-continuous. In section 8 Bitopological spaces are explained.

Complete in thesis $\TSP$, $\TSQ$ and $\TSR$ denote the topological spaces $(\TSP,\tau)$, $(\TSQ,\sigma)$ and $(\TSR, \eta)$ respectively for which separation axioms are not assumed untill mentioned explicitly. For each subset $\clrD$ of a space $(P, \tau)$, the closure of $\clrD$, interior of $\clrD$, semi-interior of $\clrD$, semi-closure of $\clrD$, w-interior of $\clrD$, ws-closure of $\clrD$, and the complement of $\clrD$ are denoted by $\mbox{cl}(\clrD)$ or $\tau-\mbox{cl}(\clrD)$, $\mbox{int}(\clrD)$ or $\tau-\mbox{int}(\clrD)$, $\mbox{sint}(\clrD)$, $\mbox{scl}(\clrD)$, $\mbox{ws-int}(\clrD)$, $\mbox{ws-cl}(\clrD)$, and $\clrD^{\text{C}}$ or $\TSP$--$\TSD$ respectively.

\section[Stronger and weaker forms of open sets and closed sets]{Stronger and weaker forms of open sets and\break closed sets}\label{sec1.2}

Stone \cite{Stone} and Velicko \cite{Velicko} have popularized and investigated stronger type open sets termed as regular, strong regular open sets respectively. Levine \cite{Levine}, Bhattacharya and Lahiri \cite{Bhattacharya}, Mashhour \cite{abd}, Biswas \cite{Biswas}, Gnanambal \cite{Gnanambal}, Veera Kumar \cite{Veerakumar}, Palanippan and Rao \cite{Palaniappan}, Sheik Jhon \cite{Sheik} and Nagaveni \cite{Nagaveni} have respectively determined generalized, semi-generalized, $\alpha$, semi, g*, regular generalized, g\#, w and weakly generalized closed sets. The complements of these different types of open (closed) sets are called the same type of closed (open) sets and so on. The following definitions are the prerequisites for the present study.

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.2.1}
For subset $\clrD$ of $(\TSP, \tau)$, if $\clrD \subseteq \cl$ $(\mbox{int} (\clrD))$ then it is semi open set and If int $(\cl(\clrD)) \subseteq \clrD$ then it is semi closed set \cite{Levine1}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.2.2}
For subset $\clrD$ of $(P, \tau)$, if $\clrD \subseteq \mbox{int}(\cl(\clrD))$ then it is pre-open set (1982) and if $\cl(\mbox{int}(\clrD)) \subseteq \clrD$then it is pre-closed set \cite{Arya1}. 
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.2.3}
For subset $\clrD$ of $(P, \tau)$, if $\clrD \subseteq\mbox{int} (\cl(\mbox{int}(\clrD)))$ then it is $\alpha$-open set \cite{Njastad} (1965) and if $\cl(\mbox{int}(\cl(\clrD)))\subseteq \clrD$ then it is $\alpha$-closed set.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.2.4}
For subset $\clrD$ of $(\TSP, \tau)$, if $\clrD \subseteq \cl(\mbox{int}(\cl(\clrD))))$ then it is semi-pre-open set (1986) ($\beta$-open \cite{abd}) and if $\mbox{int}(\cl(\mbox{int}(\clrD))) \subseteq \clrD$ then it is a semi-pre closed set ($\beta$-closed). 
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.2.5}
For a subset $\clrD$ of $(\TSP, \tau)$, if $\clrD = \mbox{int} (\cl(\clrD))$ then it is regular open set (1937) and if $\clrD = \cl(\mbox{int}(\clrD))$ then it is a regular closed set \cite{Long}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.2.6}
For subset $\clrD$ of $(\TSP, \tau)$, if there is a regular open set $\TSP$ such that $\TSP \subseteq \clrD \subseteq \alpha \cl(\TSP)$ then it is regular semi open set (1978) \cite{Cameron}. 
\end{dfn}


\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.2.7}

\section{ws-Continuous maps and irresolute maps}

In general topology, the concept of continuous functions plays a very important role.

Walli \cite{Wali4} has explored regular continuous and completely, semi,  $\alpha$, pre, g.sg, gpr, rg, w, $\alpha rw$-continuous. Irresolute maps were innovated and explored by Crossely and Hildebrand \cite{Crossley}.

\section{Bitopological spaces}

Kelly \cite{Kelly} initiated a systematic study of the concept of bitopological spaces in 1963. Furthers various authors, like Arya and Nour \cite{Arya2}, Di Maio and Noiri \cite{Noiri2}, Fukutake \cite{Fukutake2}, Reilly \cite{Reilly}, Popa \cite{Popa1}, Maki \cite{Maki6}, Arockiarani \cite{Arockiarani}, Gnanambal \cite{Gnanambal} and Sheik Jhon \cite{Sheik} have changed their attention to put the individual concepts of topology to bitopological spaces. Here we define some of the definitions, which are used in our study. 

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.6.1}
Let $\TSi, \TSj\in \{1, 2\}$ be fixed integers. In a bitopological space $(\TSP, \tau_1, \tau_2)$, a subset $\clrD$ of $(\TSP, \tau_1, \tau_2)$ is said to
\begin{enumerate}[\rm (i)]
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-g\#-closed \cite{Veerakumar} if $\tau_\TSj- \cl(\clrD)\subset \TSM$ when $\clrD\subset\TSM$ and $\TSM\in \tau_\TSi$,
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-*g$\alpha$-closed \cite{Vigneshwaran} if $\tau_\TSj$-$\cl(\clrD)\subset\TSM$ when $\clrD\subset\TSM$ and $\TSM$ is regular open in $\tau_\TSi$,
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-g$\xi$*-closed \cite{VivekPrabu} if $\tau_\TSj$-$\mbox{pcl}(\clrD) \subset\TSM$ when $\clrD\subset\TSM$ and $\TSM$ is regular open in $\tau_i$,
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-$\alpha$gp-closed \cite{Navalagi2} if $\tau_\TSj$-$\cl(\tau_\TSi-\mbox{int}(\clrD))\subset\TSM$ when $\clrD\subset\TSM$ and $\TSM\in\tau_\TSi$,
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-$\ddot{g}$-closed \cite{key} if $\tau_\TSj-\cl(\clrD) \subset \TSM$ when $\clrD\subset\TSM$ and $\TSM$ is semiopen in $\tau_\TSi$,
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-rb-closed \cite{Nagaveni2} if $\tau_\TSj$-$\mbox{pcl}(\clrD) \subset\TSM$ when $\clrD\subset\TSM$ and $\TSM\in\tau_\TSi$,
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-gspr-closed \cite{Navalagi} if $\tau_\TSj$-$\cl(\clrD) \subset \TSM$ when $\clrD \subset \TSM$ and $\TSM\in\mbox{GO}(\TSP, \tau_\TSi)$.
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-gsp-closed \cite{Dontchev} if $\tau_\TSj$-$\cl(\clrD) \subset \TSM$ when $\clrD \subset \TSM$ and $\TSM\in \mbox{GO}(\TSP, \tau_\TSi)$.
\item $(\TSi, \TSj)$-rgb-closed \cite{Mariappa} if $\tau_\TSj$-$\cl(\clrD) \subset \TSM$ when $\clrD \subset \TSM$ and $\TSM\in \mbox{GO}(\TSP, \tau_i)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}

The complements of the above mentioned closed sets are their respective open sets. 

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.6.2}
A map $\TSh:(\TSX, \tau_{1}, \tau_{2})\to (\TSY, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2})$ is called
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\tau_{\TSj}$-$\sigma_{\TSk}$-continuous \cite{Maki6} if $f^{-1}(\TSV)\in \tau_{\TSj}$ for every $\TSV\in\sigma_{\TSk}$,

\item $\TSC(\TSi,\TSj)$-$\sigma_{\TSk}$-continuous \cite{Shaik John} if $f^{-1}(\TSV)\in \TSC(\TSi,\TSj)$ for every $\sigma_{\TSk}$-closed set in $(\TSV,\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2})$,

\item $\TSD(\TSi,\TSj)$-$\sigma_{\TSk}$-continuous \cite{Maki6} if $f^{-1}(\TSV)\in \TSD(\TSi,\TSj)$ for every $\sigma_{\TSk}$-closed set in $(\TSY,\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2})$,

\item $\TSW(\TSi,\TSj)$-$\sigma_{\TSk}$-continuous \cite{Fukutake} if $f^{-1}(\TSV)\in \TSW(\TSi,\TSj)$ for every $\sigma_{\TSk}$-closed set in $(\TSY,\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2})$,

\item $\clrD_{\TSr}(\TSi,\TSj)$-$\sigma_{\TSk}$-continuous \cite{Arockiarani} if $f^{-1}(\TSV)\in \clrD_{\TSr}(\TSi,\TSj)$ for every $\sigma_{\TSk}$-closed set in $(\TSY,\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2})$,

\item $\zeta(\TSi,\TSj)$-$\sigma_{\TSk}$-continuous \cite{Gnanambal} if $f^{-1}(\TSV)\in\zeta(\TSi,\TSj)$ for every $\sigma_{\TSk}$-closed set in $(\TSY,\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.6.3}
A map $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau_1, \tau_2)\rightarrow(\TSQ \sigma_1, \sigma_2)$ is termed bi-continuous \cite{Maki6} if $\TSh$ is $\tau_1$-$\sigma_1$-continuous and $\tau_2$-$\sigma_2$-continuous.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn1.6.4}
A map $\TSh: (\TSP, \tau_1, \tau_2)\rightarrow(\TSQ \sigma_1, \sigma_2)$ is termed strongly-bi-continuous \cite{Maki6} (briefly s-bi-continuous) if $\TSh$ is bi-continuous, $\tau_1$-$\sigma_2$-continuous and $\tau_2$-$\sigma_1$-{\break}continuous,
\end{dfn}

\section{Some separation axioms in topological spaces}

From the literature survey on separation axioms we observed that there is a significant work for different relatively weak form of separation axioms like $\TST_\TSk$ spaces $(\TSk=0, 1, 2)$, normal and regular axioms in particular several other neighbouring forms of them have been studied in many papers.

Maheshwari and Prasad \cite{Maheshwari} established and deliberated the new class of space called s-normal space using semi-open sets. It was further studied by Noiri \cite{Dontchev2} and Arya \cite{Arya1} introduced g-regular and g-normal spaces using g-closed sets. Noiri and Popa \cite{Popa} further investigated the concepts introduced by Sheik John \cite{Sheik1} introduced and studied the w-normal, w-regular using w-closed sets.
