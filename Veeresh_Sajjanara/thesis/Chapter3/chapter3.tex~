Algorithm[section]

Hand-drawn figures, downloaded/created images \& graphs need to be inserted in a document. There are different ways to insert these in a document. 


\section{Insert an image}

One image as in Figure \ref{Fig21} is to be inserted. Looks good if it is located in the center. The size can be adjusted to suit the needs. 

\section{introduction}

The concept of continuous functions plays a very important role in general topology. The regular continuous and completely continuous functions are introduced and studied by Arya S P [2]. Later, R S wali et all [31] introduced and investigated Î±rw-continuous functions in topological spaces. 
Second part of this chapter, a new class of maps called weakly semi closed-continuous (briefly, ws-continuous) maps are introduced and analyzed their properties with other existing generalized continuous maps.
Third part of this chapter, we analyse the concepts of ws-irresolute maps and strongly ws-continuous maps in topological spaces and investigate some of their properties.
