\chapter{Mysore District Environment}

Assemblage of birds found in any region is governed by 
environmental conditions stretching across the territory. The 
topography, climate and type of vegetation which is directly or 
indirectly influenced by climate give rise to varied habitats in 
the environment. Their conditions are further modified by seasonal 
changes which trigger various natural phenomenon like flowering, 
winter leaf-fall, bursting forth of new leaves, breeding 
activity, migration, emergence of insects, and abundance of 
birds. An overview of the part of the region that constitutes 
Mysore District will give us a broad perspective against which 
the bird life can be observed. It will also help in understanding 
ecological relations of the birds. 

Even within the natural settings human pressure is increasing 
and the landscape is undergoing slow and gradual change. Some 
of the original landscapes which constituted well wooded areas a 
few centuries back have all but vanished. The earlier reports 
mentioned about the most magnificent forests that existed around 
Begur \& Kakankot. The forests in these areas have been over exploited 
for teak and rosewood. 

In some places the forests stand as vestiges at the edge of 
man made environment. In places forests have shrunk giving rise 
to newer landscapes called scrub with stunted trees intermingled 
with thorny thickets. The afforested areas with newer species 
have created totally different conditions in the protected areas. 
Return to the natural flora may be taking place gradually. Incidentally 
the birds have not totally shied away from these newer 
environments. However the species composition will not be the 
same and change according to availability of food, cover, and 
availability of breeding places. Many have taken refuge in parks 
and gardens in urban areas which more or less present woodland 
scenarios. 

Geographically Mysore district (co ordinates 11$^\circ$.36 13$^\circ$.35 
North, 75$^\circ$.55$-$77$^\circ$.20 East) is situated at the southern tip of 
Deccan Plateau. The southern plateau stretches from the foothills 
of the Western Ghats to the broken chain of Eastern Ghats with 
average elevation of 800 mt. and covers an area of 16.00 KM$^2$. It 
is an elevated table land broken up by rocky hills and scored by 
deep ravines and extends upto foothills of Nilgiri in south. On 
the Southern side we find Gopalaswamy Hills while Billigirirangan 
hills stretch on South eastern side. Malai Mahadeshwara Hills 
extends towards Eastern Ghats. 

The area between the hill region is a rolling plain called 
in Kannada Bayalusime. The river Cauvery flows across the eastern 
side of the district and the Southern border is delimited by 
Moyar river which courses through the thickly wooded jungles. The 
river Kabini drains northwards across the Southern Plateau and 
joins Cauvery at T.Narsipur. 

The forest belt runs through West Hunsur Taluk and spreads 
into Southern region around the hill ranges which include the 
famous Nagarhole and Bandipur. Very dense tropical forests surround 
the extreme south along the Moyar river. In the Southwest 
region the semi-evergreen and deciduous forests give way to 
scrub jungles. Such jungles are seen on the lower elevation of 
Chamundi Hills, Yelwal, area surrounding Sargur, Arekankadu (on 
way to Bandipur) and at the foot of major hill ranges. 

The further degradation of the scrub jungles is seen in 
areas close to human habitation where these regions are converted 
into barren landscapes (28\%). The total forested area in Southern 
part of the district is 1,18,220 hectare, which is above 5\% of 
the total geographical area. About 48\% of land lying in lower 
elevation is cultivated. The central portion of the district is 
intensively farmed. The Irrigation channels run through this 
portion. There are a large number of shallow irrigation tanks. 
The total water spread including reservoirs is 29,800 hectares. 
The wetlands including reservoirs, tanks, rivers, irrigational 
channels are about 1\% of the total area. 

\chapter{Natural Vegetation}

The vegetation forms major habitats. The habitats and their 
sub-divisions will ultimately form specific niches. Birds show 
fine adaptations to the niche. Niche could be considered as a 
kind of address of bird. 

In the Mysore District we may differentiate vegetation in 
three major types. 
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep=2pt
\item Moist Deciduous Forests 

\item Dry Deciduous Forests 

\item Thorn Scrub Forests 
\end{enumerate} 

\underline{Moist Deciduous Forest} are seen between Kakanakote and
Kerala borders, higher slopes of B.R. Hills and M.M. Hills. Tree 
layers are with open canopy. In this area the timber trees like 
Nandi, Teak, Matti are dominant. Thick climbers and epiphytic 
orchids dot some trees. Due to open canopy shrub layer grows 
underneath and is made up predominantly by Bodin gida and Kodasize. 

\underline{Dry Deciduous Forests} are adapted to long dry period. The 
trees are shorter and often protected by thorns and prickles. 
Thorny thickets form undergrowth. Climbers are wiry and often 
with latex. Xerophytes are not uncommon. Dinduga. Alule and 
Taremara form principle broad leaved trees. The forest looks 
resplendent with yellow flowers of Arsina burges during dry 
months. Such areas are found in the forest of Nagarhole, Bandipur, 
Nugu and lower parts of B.R. Hills. 

\underline{Thorn Scrub Forests} : As trees thin the woodlands are turned 
into wood Savannah landscape. With further degradations only isolated 
thickets dot the country side ultimately giving way to 
scrub. These stages are seen between Gundalpet and Gopalaswamy 
Betta. Thorn scrub type plant cover is usually found in low 
rainfall areas. The trees are slow growing, twisted and stunted 
and armed. The hardy species like Ane, Gobli, Kudussage, Chigare 
abound here. Shrubs are wiry and thorny and form impenetrable 
undergrowth. This is very well seen in Chikkanhalli forest and 
along Chamundi Hills. 

Besides these principle vegetation and divisions, sholas are 
found in B.R. Hills at 1400 1800 m. Along the principle river 
are seen the typical riverine forests. In the innumerable wetlands 
are seen water plants like nymphaea, nelumbo, aaponogeton, 
potamogeton and submerged plants like hydrilla, hydrophylla and 
other pond weeds. Many water bodies are covered with water hyacinth. 
The emergents like bulrushes and phragmites border along 
the marshes. These can be seen along the shallow regions in 
Kukarahallikere, Dadahalli, Mugunhundikere. 

A large number of trees are planted in open fields on the 
borders of arable lands, in village topes and along roadside. Besides 
large tracts of barren wasteland and hilly areas have been 
afforested with mainly eucalyptus species. One can even see a 
regenerated forest at Chikkanahalli near Mysore. This background 
will serve as a framework for understanding ecological relationship 
of birds. It is a virgin field and every bird watcher can 
contribute towards the knowledge of bird ecology. One can also 
enhance the pleasure of bird watching by sharing his experience 
with others. 

\chapter{Distribution of birds in the region}

The humid hills of Kerala, Wynad, part of Mysore, Bandipur, 
Nagarahole, Madhumalai form a contiguous sub region of Western 
Ghats. The bird life in this area is very characteristic and 
resembles species which occur in the North East India and Burma. 
Besides climate and availability of food, the other factors like 
height of the trees, open or closed canopy, secondary growth 
nesting material, open spaces and roads are important factors in 
the distribution of birds. The broad leaves trees in the dry 
deciduous forest provide habitats for large number of birds. 
Hence highest number of species are recorded in dry deciduous 
forest. Similarly large number of species are found where man has 
altered the landscape by selection of trees species and the 
distribution of the trees. It is usually mixed with natural 
growth. This gives rise to variety of covers in parks, campuses, 
gardens. The diversity of environment is artificially high and it 
attracts large number of birds. In degraded forests the number of 
species gradually diminish. In open country and agricultural 
lands the number of birds is usually sparse. Most birds come for 
foraging. On the other hand in wetlands the avifuana depends on 
richness and diversity of micro habitats. 

The list of birds found in the major habitats is appended. 
The list will serve as guidance. There may be many important 
omissions and the list can be augmented by sharing information 
with other bird watchers. Some birds will be common to all habi
tats. Many times birds from adjacent area also listed. Some birds 
are equally restricted to specific habitats. There is a lot of 
overlap seen as in nature, there are no clear cut demarcations or 
zones. Not all birds seen are found frequently. One will be able 
to make new discoveries in the course of his observations. All 
this makes bird watching an exciting hobby.

\chapter{A B C of Bird Watching}%%%4

Bird watching as an activity could be carried out for sheer 
pleasure of observing birds in their environment. After sometime 
it may become a serious study of exploring Nature. Whether it is 
pursued as a hobby or as a scientific interest, bird watching 
needs to be done in a systematic manner. 
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep=0pt
\item \underline{Before you start} : Try to get familiar with the geography of 
the area. Within 100 km you may come across different types 
of environment. It may be countryside, woodlands, forests, 
wetlands, plantations, etc.,. The birds association differ 
in different environment. They can very well be observed in 
parks, gardens and campuses. 

\item \underline{When to start} : As a beginner it is better to start when 
birds could be seen in large numbers. October to April is 
the best period. A number of migratory birds descend down to 
feed in marshes and wetlands. 

The birds are active during early morning or before 
dusk. The timings for bird watching :

\chapter{Bird Watching in C.F.T.R.I Campus}

With natural habitats disappearing in countrysides, gardens and parks 
are becoming refuge for many woodland species of birds. The gardens and 
the parks in the city are small islands of woods. C.F.T.R.I campus is a sort of 
mix of garden and park where birds have been found in fairly large numbers. 
In such an environment one can almost come in contact with nature 
everyday and experience the joy of self - discovery. 

The mansion, built in Baroque style and looking resplendent in yellow 
ochre, stands at the highest elevation of the landscape. The ledges of the 
mansion provide roosting and nesting places for the feral Blue Rock Pigeons 
which are found hovering around it with their deep gootr-goo, gootr-goo 
notes. The roads leading to various blocks and residences loop around this 
stately building. It is surrounded by 100 acres of land, which is left 
untouched and it provides plenty of cover to the avian neighbours. The 
cultivated garden in the front together with the built area occupies 
comparatively a small portion of the total ground. Within last 25 to 30 years 
of its occupation by the premiere laboratory, a large area was left 
unexploited giving rise to natural growth of vegetation. To this varied 
landscape is added the rambling hedgerows and private gardens interspersed 
with buildings and thickets. Such growth is an open invitation to a large 
number of insect species like grasshoppers, crickets and other gramnivorous 
insects. The soil is perennially covered by the grasses which grow 
luxuriantly. The leaf fall from the deciduous trees during winter, and 
aftermath of cut and dried grasses, provide rich food for fungi and ants and 
many other insects which can be seen swarming all around. The leaf litter 
found under the trees and hedges shelter a large number of bugs and beetles. 
The moths though not butterflies, deposit their eggs among the succulent 
leaves with multicolored caterpillars among the garden plants. With such 
plethora of insect life there is very abundance of food especially for the 
passerine birds. 

Since the estate was handed over to house CFTRI in 1952, lot of 
changes have taken place; the built area has increased. A mixture of natural 
and cultivated trees has occupied the campus, that is sprawling over hundred 
acres of land. A lot of shrubbery is growing along the rows of residential 
areas and the area is parceled out into boulevards, orchards and lawns. This 
man made mosaic invites a large number of woodland birds in and out of 
season. The whole campus acts like a supermarket for bird populations in 
the environment of Mysore city. 

\medskip
\heading{Bird Life}
While entering through the main gate you may witness the antics of 
the Roller or Blue Jay, with brilliant display of blue bands in flight. It is a 
beauteous bird and chosen as the Bird of Karnataka. It feasts on insects, 
pouncing on them from a vantage point. Because of its blue throat it is 
considered as incarnation of Siva. A little further, on way to the main 
building, a group of snow white little Egrets with black spear like bill will be 
seen stealthily advancing to pick up insects from the well watered lawns. 
During early periods, their lacy plumes were in great demand by milliners 
for adorning woman's hats in Europe and America. They were slaughtered 
ruthlessly almost to extinction. Luckily change in woman's fashion has 
saved them from complete extermination. A funny Spotted Owlet may be 
seen staring at you from the hollow of the large peepal tree. The ledges of 
the building provide a sanctuary for hundreds of Blue Rock Pigeons. The 
swifts too have found a refuge there. The pigeons are seen whirling round 
the building only to return hurriedly to their perch. On way to the Southern 
gate, concealed in the leafy branches of the groves of copper pods, will be 
noticed a lonely hawk, called Shikra, lying in wait for its prey which include 
young ones of birds. 

Along the culvert, on way to school, lurks the White breasted 
Water hen. It harbours along the marshy area with its family. Among the 
thickets bordering the Nullah and a patch of woodland behind the bunglows, 
I have hardly noticed any birds. Most of the varieties of birds I have noted 
are amongst the residential area behind the main building. Here, small 
flocks of crows abound. They are not the familiar House Crows with grey 
neck, but glossy jet black Jungle Crows. This is very intriguing indeed. 
Again, they have out competed the common House Sparrow from the human 
dwellings. Here and there, on open grounds, Myna's are seen loitering and 
noisily hopping. In the spring the area reverberates with kuoo-kuoo, the call 
of the male Koel. It starts with low call reaching crescendo and breaks 
abruptly; it starts all over again monotonously. It is almost enchanting music 
heard at the break of the day from spring to pre-monsoon showers. Large 
flocks of Rose ringed Parakeets, using campus as stopover, zoom across 
screaming noisily, keeak, keeak, keeack. The Pond Heron wearing its 
maroon breeding coat, and found singly, is watching patiently for its 
favourite quarry --- the frogs. From nearby tall copper pods, we hear Kutroo - Kutroo, the call of the Crimson Barbet which is often mistaken for 
woodpecker. In the bushes and the hedgerows are the flower peckers and 
warblers. Warblers are busily searching for insect larvae, constantly cocking 
their slender tail and uttering tee tee from time to time. Around the 
residential quarters, you find many other birds such as Hoopoes flashing 
their hood, Minivets, with their beautiful scarlet colouring, and Common 
Brown Babblers rummaging through the litters on the ground searching for 
their prey. We are greeted by the joyful calls of the celebrated songster, the 
Redvented Bulbul. The Crested Sepoy Bulbul makes its frequent 
appearance. Bulbuls are fond of gardens. If you are lucky you may notice a 
pair of Golden Orioles among leafy trees. The Green Bee -eaters line 
themselves on over-head wires, often seen hacking their prey or gliding back 
to their base. The Crow Pheasant are heard making deep resonant call, 
coop-coop-coop, repeated quickly. They are closely related to cuckoos, and 
are considered auspicious if one comes across them. The Spotted Dove 
enters your residence and nests in the verandah in some nook. Its calls krookruk-
krukroo ... kroo-kroo - kroo, are often heard over long distances. 

One hears cheerful towit towit notes of the Tailor bird among the 
shrubs and bush trees. One of the best songsters is the Magpie Robbin. 
Mornings are filled with its sweet songs. During breeding season, you may 
hear its plaintive notes. ``Did-he-do-it", call of Red Wattled Lapwing is very 
common. Lapwings are seen often in pair. Perhaps it is the only bird in the 
campus breeding in the open ground. I found its four stone coloured mottled 
eggs near the Technology Block. The old banyan and peepal trees are fond 
haunts of the fruit eating Common Grey Hornbill. Small parties fly in 
glidingly from tree to tree in follow my leader fashion. I have never been 
able to see, in spite of my careful search, their unique nest in which breeding 
female is imprisoned. You may also hear the chattering song of 
White breasted Kingfisher seen with its brilliant turqoise blue coloured 
feathers and with a long red beak. It is not necessarily confined to water, as 
it feeds on terrestrial insects too. 

The Purple Sunbird makes its clumsy pendulous nest right in your 
garden or inside your house. You will see pairs with distinct coloration. 
Besides you come across many other varieties of woodland birds, the larks, 
drongos, wagtails, munias, minivets, Grey Tit, and raptors. Small parties of 
White Ibis are seen occasionally mingled with Egrets. 

Birds are driven by their appetite, perching places, suitable nesting 
sites, and mixed vegetation. Correlation will be found with the type of vegetation. The vegetation in the campus is of secondary 
type and it provides less habitable sites for birds. Their density depends on 
these factors. As there are no suitable nesting places, we do not come across 
resident birds, except Blue Rock Pigeons. The birds sneak in from outside on a brief visit, 
mainly for feeding. But it is still a wonder that within 100 acres, I could 
come across 53 species of birds belonging to 32 families. 

From 1986 onwards, I have made several tours around the campus on 
weekends to study the birds. I have tried to focus attention on their 
association with the background. So far as illustrations are concerned, one 
will find excellent coloured plates in Salim Ali's ``The Book of Indian 
Birds". The real joy will be in watching them yourself; all you need is a
binocular and a guide. There are many more fascinating facts of bird life 
awaiting your discovery. 

\chapter{Wetland Birds in Mysore District}%%%%6 

Wetlands in general include lakes, rivers, streams, 
tanks, marshes, esturities, deltas, seashores, mangrove swamps 
and coral reefs. Lakes include small and large irrigation 
tanks also. Birds are usually abundant on lakes and estuaries. 

There are a large number of irrigation tanks scattered 
all over Mysore District. In the south west region, they are 
perennial (8-10 months full of water). There are 20 major 
tanks with water spread area exceeding 200 hectares. Most 
of these tanks are fed by streams, and water level increases 
after monsoon showers. 

A typical tank scenario consists of uplands bordered 
with trees, with lowland grasses sloping towards the shallow 
water zone of the tank. The interface between land and water 
shows clear zones with sedge's, rushes, reeds, submerged water 
weeds and floating vegetation from shallow to deeper waters 
in that order. This presents a very scenic view with placid 
open waters. There is a luxuriant growth of plankton in the 
open waters due to abundance of sunshine in the region. This 
gives rise to richness of crustacean and insect larvae 
supporting myriads of fish life. This in turn supports 
diversity of bird life. The richness of avifauna depends on 
variety of micro habitats created by vegetation and 
topography. 

The marshy areas at the edge of water are more
productive and a large number of birds are found actively 
feeding here especially the waders. Some of ducks and geese 
which are herbivorous also prefer marsh water interface. The 
colour of the water could be a good indicator of the degree 
of pollution. The water may be clear or turbid or greenish 
with nutrient-rich influx from surroundings or dirty, being 
highly polluted. 

The sandpipers, stilts and wagtails will be waiting in 
the low lands covered with grasses for feeding on insect 
larvae and worms. In the sedge's will be found warblers 
strutting and flying from bed to bed. 

The zone of emergent vegetation like reed beds are 
inhabited by moorhens and other gallinules. 

Sometimes weaver birds build nests in colonies by 
slinging together the long leaves of macrophytes typha. The 
gallinules also make use of them building platform nests. 
Diving ducks will be found in fishing open waters The coots 
will be found ranging over the entire wetlands. 

The trees provide perching places for cormorants, storks 
and King fisher. The conmorants will be found drying their 
wings on the rocks after diving for fish since they cannot 
fly efficiently with wet feathers. Pelicans and coots are 
usually found on large tanks where fish is abundant. On the 
large trees around, a number of water birds will be roosting 
and build their nests in single or mixed colonies. Herons 
nest in colonies in places called as heronaries. 

Herons are also wading birds, patiently waiting for 
their prey on the edge of the water. Gray heron, a 
solitary large bird (3ft), will be seen on most of the tanks. 
Its neck is slender with kink and has large toes to balance 
its body on soft mud while foraging. 

The spot billed ducks are common resident ducks on most 
of the tanks. Their numbers are seen augmented during winter 
when they are found amidst migratory ducks. The floating 
vegetation's provide walking pads for jacanas which balance 
themselves with long toes, seeking invertebrates and tiny 
frogs. 

The common kingfisher founds singly by the tank plunge 
dives to fish while the pied kingfisher hovers over the water 
in a stationery position and hurls itself with great speed at 
water to catch fish. 

\section*{Migratory Birds:} 

During every winter (beginning with October-November 
onwards) a large number of ducks, geese and waders start 
arriving on water bodies in South with unfailing accuracy. 
They come from eastern Germany, Europe, Siberia, Central Asia 
and as far as China, crossing thousands of miles. They 
scatter over all the major tanks. It is a great spectacle to 
be observed on the wetlands around Mysore. They include 
garneys (blue winged teal), cotton teal, pintai1s, 
pochards, shovellers, Black winged stilts, sandpipers, the 
bar headed goose and some small birds. They come in large 
flock of hundreds, with exception of shovellers who are seen 
in few numbers. Gargneys and pintails are commonest. A 
marsh harrier is also a common winter visitor seen singly 
hovering over the reed beds to pick up unspecting prey. Only 
a few migratory storks could be seen. One may occasionally 
come across a small flock of lesser flamingoes  or a few 
stragglers left behind. On some tanks painted storks are 
common. They have been found breeding near Karanjikere on the tall 
trees surrounding the area. 

Most of the migratory birds depart by March. Every year
since 1987, Asian Waterfowl Census is carried out- in the 
month of January all over India and neighbouring S.Asia. 
Since bird watchers from Mysore very actively participate in 
this programme of international significance, the amateurs 
and new comers with background in bird watching should join 
and enjoy the watching the unusual spectacle of bird 
migration right at their doorstep.
