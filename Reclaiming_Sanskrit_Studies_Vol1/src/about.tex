Infinity Foundation (IF) has a 25-year track record of mapping the Kurukshetra in the field of Indology, and producing game-changing original research using the Indian lens to study India ssand the world. 

One of the goals of Infinity Foundation India (IFI), an offspring of IF, in organising Swadeshi Indology Conference Series is to develop, fund, and groom scholars who can methodically respond to the western worldview of Indology.

We are proud to say that within one year of the birth of the Swadeshi Indology Conference Series, we have conducted two high impact conferences with quality output for publications, as well as two impressive monographs. These monographs will be published and distributed in academia worldwide. They will be used in platforms for academic debate by our scholars.

We have begun to build a team of young scholars with swadeshi drishti. Our mission is to build a home team of 108 scholars who will form the basis for developing a civilizational grand narrative of India.
