ACCS delivered its 25$^{\text{th}}$ edition of its flagship event - ADCOM 2019, earlier this month and there was higher anticipation of it being different from its previous editions. The event did not belie people’s expectations. Besides the high-profile keynote lectures, ACCS honored the doyens of Indian computing and communications science through the release of a Special Postal Cover by the Department of Posts, Government of India immortalizing the contributions of Late Dr. N. Seshagiri, Prof. V. Rajaraman, Dr. S. Ramani and Shri N. Vittal. Each one of them has strived in his own unique way to help build the Indian saga of computing and communications. For more on this, please see a special report on this event.

ADCOM 2019 explored the new generation of cellular and wireless communication, generally known as 5G (5th Generation). 5G promises to revolutionize wireless and mobile communication in innumerable ways giving rise to a new ecosystem and economy. A global roll out is underway in a phased manner yet many aspects of technical, infrastructural, policy matters are still evolving. It is in a way a giant leap for the communication industry which impacts every other segment of the society. The conference was held in Indian Institute of Information Technology-Bangalore (IIIT-B) from 5th September – 7th September, 2019.
