\medskip

We dedicate this book to all the children in the US who have
formed racist views of India and Hinduism due to the Hinduphobic
materials taught in their classrooms.
It is also dedicated to the hundreds of school children who traveled
to the State Board of Education in Sacramento to explain how
these materials resulted in them being bullied, mocked, and feeling
shame in their heritage, and their parents who had helped
reinforce their values despite what was taught in school.
To Arjun Maheshwari, Nitya Maheshwari, and Hari Maheshwari
who will inherit the instructional materials resulting from our
engagements.}
