This book is an offering to my gurus Sri Aurobindo-Mother and Devraha Baba, without the grace of whom it would not have been possible. I am grateful to Kalyan Vishwanathan, whose financial help from Sanatana Dharma Foundation and Dharma Civilization Foundation has helped me to do research which has gone behind the production of this book. I am extremely thankful to Rajiv Malhotra—who gave us the idea that we should convert our critique of McGraw Hill’s World History textbooks into a book—for the support that he provided us through Infinity Foundation in getting the book published, printed, and publicized. Last but not the least, to Krishna Maheshwari, who had conceptualized much before my knowing it that I would be an ideal candidate from the academia to offer and produce a multi-faceted critique of the Hinduphobic materials in the concerned textbooks, for making the work possible through his dedicated and arduous fund-raising efforts through Hindupedia.

wife, Annu, who has patiently allowed me to spend unending hours (outside my day job) drafting reviews for the State Board of Education \& associated commissions and for allowing me to take time off from work for many day trips to Sacramento.
