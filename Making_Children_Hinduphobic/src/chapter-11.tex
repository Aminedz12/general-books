\section*{Analysis and Critique} 

As far as the first quote is concerned, it violates evaluation criteria pertaining to accuracy and inclusion of best recent scholarship. All the dates regarding the Indian history, particularly prehistory, are extremely controversial. It will be advisable to not mention the dates of ancient works like the Mahabharata war, at all.

Regarding the second quote, it is in violation of California Education Codes 51501 and 60044—adverse reflection—and evaluation criteria clauses pertaining to perpetrating Eurocentric and Ethnocentric views (continuing with the missionary and imperialistic writings on Hinduism), not remaining neutral in matters of religion, and thereby instilling prejudice in Hindu and non-Hindu children against Hinduism.

This statement over-simplifies the Bhagavad Gita, one of Hinduism's most prominent scriptures. Krishna tells the prince the nature of the atman, the mechanism through which enlightenment can be achieved, concepts of dharma and karma, the three types of yoga, and many profound ideas that make the text a principle one for Hindus to guide their lives and lead a life centered in the Divine. 

The author(s) of the McGraw Hill text show one of the most prominent God of Hinduism—Krishna—as a war hungry God, inciting Arjuna to fight, and as an unethical and immoral God, prodding Arjuna to fight his own family members, thereby equating Hinduism with violence, war, immorality, and unethical behavior. So much for representing properly one of the two most prominent epics of the Hindus!

274 & Second epic, the Ramayana, is a poem that grew to about 25,000 verses before it was written down. It tells the story of Rama, the perfect king, and Sita, his faithful wife. When Sita is kidnapped by an evil king, Rama rushes to her rescue with the help of friends. \tabularnewline

\section*{Analysis and Critique} 

This is in violation of California Education Codes 51501 and 60044—adverse reflection—and evaluation criteria clauses pertaining to historical inaccuracy, not including variety of perspectives and debates, not including best recent scholarship, perpetrating Eurocentric and Ethnocentric history, not remaining neutral in matters of religion (continuing with the missionary and imperialistic writings on Hinduism), and thereby instilling prejudice in Hindu and non-Hindu children against origins of Hinduism and Hinduism per se.

It is inaccurate to state that the poem grew to about 25,000 verses before it was written down. It was authored by Sage Valmiki (and hence, is also known as the Valmiki Ramayana). Over 300 different versions of the poem are known to exist—each of which draw from Valmiki's original text.

The description provided of the Ramayana belittles a scripture that is loved, worshipped, and recited by millions of Hindus around the world and is very inaccurate. Sita was not kidnapped when Rama was on the throne (as is implied) nor did he rush to her rescue with the help of his friends. It took him approximately one year to find her and he had allies who supported the invasion of Lanka, the kingdom of the evil king, and helped him win the resulting war. In fact, he did not have his kingdom (Kosala) or its army at his side at all, for he was in exile then. 

German Indologists and European missionaries have particularly been invested in claiming that none of the ancient sacred writings of the Hindus, including the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Gita have single authorship. All throughout this claim has been contested by Indian Indologists, most recently by Adluri and Bagchee (2014).

This is inaccurate on multiple accounts. The Bhagavad Gita is well known to have been authored by Sage Veda Vyasa (who also authored the Mahabharata). 

Further, the Mahabharata is an “Itihasa” or “historical” text (within the pantheon of texts considered as Hindu scripture). Thus, to call it a “religious epic” is inaccurate.

Both statements are derogatory to Hindus. In addition, German Indologists and European Christian missionaries have particularly been invested in claiming that none of the ancient sacred writings of the Hindus, including the Ramayana and Mahabharata, have single authorship. All throughout this claim has been contested by Indian Indologists, most recently by Adluri and Bagchee (2014).

280 & So spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts. And sighing, “I will not fight!” held silence then To whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata!) While the Prince wept despairing ‘twixt [between] those hosts, Krishna made answer in divinest verse: KRISHNA: Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak’st Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart Mourn [feel sadness] not for those that live, nor those that die.Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these, Ever was not, nor ever will not be, For ever and for ever afterwards. All, that doth [do] live, lives always! To man’s frame As there come infancy and youth and age, So come there raisings-up and layings-down Of other and of other life-abodes [homes], Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks [annoys]-Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements-Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,‘Tis brief and mutable [changeable]! Bear with it, Prince! As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved, The soul that with a strong and constant calm Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently, Lives in the life undying! That which is Can never cease to be; that which is not Will not exist. \tabularnewline

First of all, this translation is archaic, which was done by Sir Edwin Arnold in the nineteenth century. The translation apart from being inaccurate is also terse, which will not make sense to a sixth-grade student. There are good English translations available by scholar-practitioner Hindus, whose translations are not only accurate but also contemporary. Sir Edwin Arnold is not considered to be an authority of the Gita and provides a colonial perspective on the text. It is also inappropriate to have a translation of a Hindu scripture by a self-proclaimed Christian be presented as a primary source on Hinduism. This is particularly important when missionary Christianity has not shied away from considering Hinduism as a pagan and heathen religion and has a stated aim of converting Hindus to Christianity.

This is a translation of Manu Smriti by Georg Bühler, who did it in the nineteenth century. Apart from the translation being inaccurate, it also is archaic. The publisher could have included more recent and contemporary scholarship. Citing the work of Inden (1990) we have argued that part of the colonial and orientalist project was to show Indian rulers as oppressive, savage, and absolutist. There are many passages in Manu Smriti that show that there were checks and balances on the rulers and that they could not act arbitrarily according to their whims and fancies. The authors of this McGraw Hill text have used those portions of Manu Smriti that validate and substantiate the imperialistic and orientalist project. Manu Smriti is considered as one of the important texts for social governance that Hindus used—it is a different matter that there are more illumined and liberal texts, which Imperialists, Orientalists, and Missionaries have continually ignored. By selectively using these translations, there is a deliberate attempt on part of McGraw Hill to show Hindus and Hinduism in poor light, and therefore it invites the charge of “adverse reflection” and instilling prejudice among Hindu and non-Hindu children against Hinduism.

\section*{Analysis and Critique} 

This is in violation of evaluation criteria clauses pertaining to not including best recent scholarship and denial of voice to ethnic groups whose tradition is being represented.

This translation is archaic, which was done by Ralph T. H. Griffith in the nineteenth century. There are better English translations available by scholar-practitioner Hindus, whose translations are contemporary.

EM66 & When a king named Dharmaputra died, his faithful dog followed him all the way to heaven. “You may come in, but your pet must stay behind,” the gatekeeper said. Dharmaputra so loved his dog that he refused to enter without it. \tabularnewline

\section*{Analysis and Critique} 

This is in violation of evaluation criterion clause pertaining to accuracy.

The name is of the King is incorrect for this is a story from the Mahabharata. The King being referred to as “Dharmaputra” is Yudhishthira. The story itself is also incorrectly summarized and the explanation of why the king refused to enter Heaven without the dog is also incorrect. Please see the summary of the story (with explanation):

Upon the onset of the Kali yuga and the departure of Krishna, Yudhishthira and his brothers retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to have survived the war of Kurukshetra: Arjuna's grandson, Parikshit. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the Himalayas.

The journey was arduous and all the family members of Yudhishthira died on way barring the dog. On reaching the top, Indra asked him to abandon the dog before entering the Heaven. But Yudhishthira refused to do so, citing the dog's unflinching loyalty as the reason. It turned out that the dog was his god-father Dharma in disguise (see Agarwal 2002).
